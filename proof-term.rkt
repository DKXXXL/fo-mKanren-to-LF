;;;  but I think we are working on dynamic typed staff
;;;  (fresh (x) (disj (== x 5) (== x "1"))) is acceptable
;;; maybe we only need to specify that we are quantifying around set (5, "1", cons ..) or 
;;;   prop (== ... , disj, conj ...), 
;;; another issue is that wholeType is necessary here, because term 
;;; (5, refl) : (ex x, x == 5)
;;; (5, refl) : (ex x, 5 == 5)

;;;  it is not really "type", more like sum type of several type

;;;     which are the meta-data

;;; The following data structure is to construct LF-term when searching
;;;   might not be useful now 

;;; proof-terms with holes!
;;;  basically incomplete proof terms
;;;  hole as meta-variable

;;; this is direct style, but at the end we only need something 
;;;   to represent a tree with a hole
;;;   the following traversal will be expensive... maybe
;;;   use (prooftree -> prooftree) as a tree with one hole
;;;   will be much less expensive
;;;   but a tree with several holes inside requires some
;;;   kind of algebraid design and interface to maintain the
;;;    invariance... let's postpone it TODO!
