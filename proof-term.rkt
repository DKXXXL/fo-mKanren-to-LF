;;; it suppose to have bindingType, i.e. (LFsigma ex bindingType body)
;;;  but I think we are working on dynamic typed staff
;;;  (fresh (x) (disj (== x 5) (== x "1"))) is acceptable
;;; maybe we only need to specify that we are quantifying around set (5, "1", cons ..) or 
;;;   prop (== ... , disj, conj ...), 
;;; another issue is that wholeType is necessary here, because term 
;;; (5, refl) : (ex x, x == 5)
;;; (5, refl) : (ex x, 5 == 5)

;;; we introduce another proof term
;;;   called (ex-for var binding-domain goal) 
;;;   it has closed semantic to (forall v domain goal)
;;;   difference is that, binding-domain has to be non-empty (of goals)
;;;   It is mainly used for justifying (ex) goal, because once (ex) goal
;;;     is done, we actually get a state as a result, a state is actually a set of 
;;;     value each variable can take restricted value from the state, but not ground/concrete value
;;;   var is a single variable, corresponds the current (ex v goal)
;;; this can be considered as a proof term combined of lambdas, lets 
;;;     note that the introduced free variables are attached to the binding-domain
;;;     so semantically we don't ask for "arbitrary free variable", but just ask for the existence of
;;; one value for the "free variable" in the binding domain
;;;  and to check the correctness of this proof term, we only need to, during proof-check (elaboration)
;;;   to verify that there are concrete/grounded value that satisfies binding-domain

;;; notice: this proof term can inhabit in existential, and also inhabited in universal
;;;       quantifier
